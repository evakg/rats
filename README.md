Avocados and Rats?
=================

This project was originally created to illustrate the dichotomy that is living new york, constantly surrounded by the ungodly rich and the tragically poor. 


It then transformed into a slightly less heavy project, one that shows the humour of the the world, because if we can't laugh, what is the point? After a lengthy process of trial and error (more error than trial to be compeltely honest) I stumbled upon this version of the project. 

The conception
------------

Since real estate was too tight lipped to get any data from, I thought if I can't make people aware of the wealth gap that lives in new york, and they way they add to by spending money at places that gentrify neighborhoods... I'll make them uncomfortable with where they spend their money through health violations. 

**Voila!** This project was born.




### Avocados? Really?

Everyone knows that millennials would be able to afford houses if they stopped buying avo toast. It is a known fact. Avocado toast is  what the jello mold was to the 50's. It is **The Thing** to show you are an young contemporary<sup>tm</sup>. So what better to make a map of than where to get this validation in the form of overprices toast? 

WE MUST KNOW THE CLOSEST PLACE TO GET AVOTO AT ALL TIMES

### Okay sureee...? But whats with the rats?

Myyy what big rats you have new york... All the better to make you squirm with my dear!
*(Read in little read ridinghood voice)*

Just kidding. Kind of.

Really just to show the overlap(or lack of) bougie areas and health violations. You can draw your own conclusions from there. Is it due lack of resources? Or targetting by the FDA? I don't know, I just show the results.

### an update to this project in 2020:
The api key I was using is no longer functional, but I will leave this up just to show that I can code and am also a fun person :)
